# REAL ESTATE PRICE PREDICTION
## DESCRIPTION
This data science project explains how to create a real estate price prediction software. It predicts the future prices of real estate in Bangalore by analyzing historical data points from the dataset and applying machine learning algorithms to build a model that can predict future prices. This model can then be used to make better decisions when investing in real estate in the city.

## WORKING
We'll get data on Bangalore home prices from Kaggle.com, load it into a pandas dataframe, and then handle NA values.
Then we will normalise property size and remove some features that are superfluous.
The range of the property size will be converted into an average of the minimum and maximum.
Almost all data science techniques, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, etc., will be covered during the model construction process.
We will then apply the linear regression model on the data.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
This project uses the following technology and tools:
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
